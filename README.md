# Offline Townscaper demo

Python and http.server are required for this to work because it relies on the creation of a http server with:

```
python3 -m http.server 8034
```

Use `start.sh` to automatically start Townscaper in the browser (for me in brave but feel free to edit the script).

The is a template `.desktop` file if you want to add it to your apps.
